Marble and Granite Substances
------------

All Substances in this package are in .SBSAR format. Because each asset in this 
package is intended to give a glossy look, all files share the same editable presets.

Each Substance can be randomized by pressing the "Randomize" button found under 
procedural properties and allowing time forcthe Substance to generate.

The following are the editable presets for all the Substances. For granite, they will
appear under the "Granite" drop down button and for marble, they will appear under the 
"Marble" drop down button.

-Glossiness:
	Intensifies the glossiness map to give a more reflective appearence.
-Gloss Imperfection:
	Intensifies the glossiness from curves to make the light reflect more on
	certain portions of the surface than others. This preset requires Glossiness
	to be greater than 0.
-Bumpiness:
	Intensifies the normal map value slightly to give the appearence of depth or 
	wear to the surface. This has been set to 0 by default.
